Project Plan and Scope for Strong Password Detection
Project Repository
Strong Password Detection - GitHub Repository
Project Goals
The primary objective of this project is to develop a Python tool that helps users determine the strength of their passwords. This tool aims to promote enhanced security practices by ensuring passwords meet defined robustness criteria, thereby contributing to safer digital environments.
Problem Statement
Weak passwords are a significant vulnerability in securing online information. This project addresses the need for automated strong password verification, aiding users in creating passwords that are more resistant to cyberattacks, including those discussed in network and Windows environments.
Expected Outcomes and Deliverables
•	Python Script: A script that checks passwords against specified criteria for strength.
•	Command-Line Interface: An interface for users to easily test their passwords.
•	Documentation and User Guide: Detailed guidelines on how the tool works and how to deploy it.
•	Demonstration Video: A video tutorial demonstrating the tool in action.
•	Integration of Security Insights: Incorporating best practices and current trends from security literature.
Timeline
•	Week 1-2: Project setup, literature review, and defining security criteria based on current best practices.
•	Week 3-4: Development of the Python script and user interface.
•	Week 5: Testing and refining the tool.
•	Week 6: Documentation, video creation, and project finalization.
Integration of Security Literature
To ensure the tool aligns with modern security practices and provides substantial educational value, it will incorporate insights from the following references:
1.	Sandbu, M. (2023). This reference will help in understanding the measures necessary for ransomware protection and the role of strong passwords in securing Windows endpoints.
2.	Bijalwan, A. (2022). This book offers comprehensive knowledge on network forensics and security which will be used to contextualize the importance of password strength within overall network security frameworks.
3.	Gibner, J. (2004). Insights from this article will be used to define what constitutes a strong password and how tools like passprop.exe can be leveraged to improve password security.
4.	Nulab's Guide on Password Strength: This online resource will provide contemporary understandings and methods for assessing password strength, which will inform the criteria used in the tool.
5.	IEEE INFOCOM 2010 Proceedings: This conference paper provides relevant technological context and latest research findings that can influence the development and effectiveness of security tools like the one being developed.

The Tool
Description
The Strong Password Detection tool utilizes regular expressions to verify if a user's password meets the following criteria:
•	Minimum of eight characters.
•	Inclusion of both uppercase and lowercase letters.
•	Presence of at least one numerical digit.
Demonstration of the Tool
Users input their password into the command-line interface, and the tool evaluates it against the security criteria, providing immediate feedback on the password's strength.




Example of Usage
Strong password feedback: 
 
Feedback for insufficient strength: 
 
Conclusion
Through rigorous documentation and adherence to coding best practices, this project not only meets the academic requirements but also provides a real-world application that enhances users' digital security. This approach ensures the longevity and utility of the project, making it a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about or improving password security.
Recommendations
To further enhance the tool, future developments could integrate multi-factor authentication checks and provide more granular feedback on password weaknesses.
